"""Method 1: the relaxation solver conserves mass exactly and reaches the imposed repose angle.

These two are the reason a reader can believe anything else the product says about the pile. A solver
that loses a fraction of a percent per dump would still draw a convincing cone, and the tonnage panels
would still show plausible numbers, and every blending metric downstream would be quietly wrong.
