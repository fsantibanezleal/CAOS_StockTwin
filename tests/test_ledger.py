"""Method 8: the lot ledger keeps the mass and the provenance exact.

The provenance sum is the invariant that matters most in the whole repository. A ledger that loses or
double-counts material still draws a convincing pile and still reports plausible grades; the only way
to know it is wrong is to check the identity numerically, on every cut, on every case.
