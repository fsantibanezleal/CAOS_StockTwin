"""Method 4: the Gray-Thornton flowing-layer solver.

Four properties, each of which the published model requires and each of which a plausible-looking but
wrong discretisation would break:

* species mass is conserved by the march (the flux at both walls is zero);
* the concentration stays inside [0, 1], because a volume fraction that goes negative is not a number;
* fines end up at the BASE of the layer, which is the whole physical content of kinetic sieving;
* ``Sr = 0`` is exactly a passive tracer, which is what makes the C02 negative control meaningful.
