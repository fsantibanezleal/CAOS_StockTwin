"""The simulation driver: build a pile, reclaim it, and measure what the blending was worth.

This is the function the offline pipeline calls per case and the TypeScript live engine mirrors per
slider move. Everything it does is a pure function of ``(RunConfig, seed)``, which is what makes a
committed trace replayable (ADR-0054) and what lets the cross-lane test assert that the browser and
the pipeline agree.

The interleaving is deliberate. Real stacking and reclaiming happen at the same time, on opposite
ends of the pile, and a simulator that stacks the whole pile and only then reclaims it would produce a
different, easier problem: every cut would see every layer. Here reclaim starts once the pile holds
``start_fraction`` of its planned tonnage, and from then on both run together. That is also what makes
the starvation control C03 possible at all.
