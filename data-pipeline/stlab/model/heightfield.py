"""Method 1, the mass-conserving relaxation solver with an imposed angle of repose.

WHAT THIS IS. A height field ``h[i, j]`` receives material at a point and relaxes until no local
slope exceeds a critical value. The toppling rule is the one Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld introduced for
the sandpile automaton (Phys. Rev. Lett. 59(4), 381-384, 1987, doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381).

WHAT THIS IS NOT, said plainly because the distinction is easy to blur. BTW is a model of avalanche
size statistics under self-organized criticality, in which the critical slope is a free parameter of
the automaton and the interesting result is a power law. None of that is claimed here. Here the
critical slope is IMPOSED as the material's angle of repose, taken from published handbook ranges
(about 34 to 60 degrees for ores), and the toppling rule is used only as a mass-conserving relaxation
solver. Avalanche statistics are out of scope.

WHY IT MATTERS FOR THE PRODUCT. The relaxation is not decoration around the interesting part; it IS
the mechanism that carries material away from the dump point and down the flank, and the ordered
chain of transfers it produces is the avalanche path along which size segregation acts. Methods 1, 4
and 8 are coupled through this function's return value.

TWO INVARIANTS, both enforced by tests rather than asserted in prose:
  * mass is conserved to machine precision, because every transfer subtracts and adds the same float;
  * after convergence, no local slope exceeds the imposed repose angle beyond the tolerance.

    THE ORDER IS THE POINT. The returned sequence is the avalanche path: the highest unstable cell
    topples first, then whatever it destabilised, and so on down the flank. That ordering is the
    downslope coordinate the segregation solver marches along, so this function's return value is what
    couples methods 1, 4 and 8 together.

    HOW A CELL TOPPLES. Exactly to its repose surface, in one step. Let the cell give away a total
    ``T`` split as ``t_k = max(0, d_k - T)`` over its over-steep neighbours. Every constraint is then
    satisfied simultaneously and none is overshot, and ``T`` solves the water-filling equation
    ``T = sum_k max(0, d_k - T)``, which for the ``k`` largest excesses is ``T = (sum of those k) /
    (k + 1)``.

    WHY A PRIORITY CASCADE RATHER THAN SWEEPS. Two earlier versions of this function were too slow to
    ship, and both for the same reason. Simultaneous (Jacobi) sweeps let a cell receive from several
    neighbours at once and overshoot above the neighbour it had just fed, so the pair traded material
    back and forth: a cone that should relax in about eight steps took over a hundred sweeps and tens
    of thousands of transfers. Processing the HIGHEST unstable cell first, and applying its transfer
    immediately, makes the relaxation march monotonically downhill and removes the ping-pong entirely.
    The heap holds ``(-height, cell)`` with lazy invalidation: a stale entry is recognised because the
    cell is no longer unstable, and is dropped.

    ``active`` seeds the cascade with the cells a deposit actually touched; a cell that was stable and
    was not touched cannot have become unstable, so nothing is missed by not scanning the pad.
