"""Method 2, the five industrial stacking geometries, as deposition paths over the pad.

Each function answers one question: given the pad, the number of passes the stacker will make, and
which dump this is, WHERE does the material land? Everything else about how a pile blends follows
from that answer, which is why these are five separate named geometries and not one function with a
"spread" parameter.

DEFINITIONS, cross-checked against the sources rather than paraphrased from memory.

* **Chevron.** The stacker travels the full length of the pad along the centre line, back and forth,
  laying gable-section layers on top of one another. Schramm, "Design of blending beds", AT MINERALS
  PROCESSING 06/2021, defines it in exactly those terms. The layer thickness is the volumetric
  stacking rate divided by the travel speed. Many thin layers, and a strong toe bias, because every
  layer avalanches down the same two flanks.
* **Windrow.** The same longitudinal travel, but the deposition axis moves laterally between passes,
  so the pile is built as parallel cords stacked pyramidally. More intricate to operate, and it
  spreads the toe bias across several crests instead of concentrating it on two flanks.
* **Cone shell.** Successive cones deposited at a stepping position, each shelling over the last.
  Few effective layers per reclaim cut, which is why Bond, Coursaux and Worthington (2000), Loubser
  and de Korte (2015) and Wintz (2011) all report it as unsuitable when homogenization matters.
* **Strata.** Inclined layers built against one flank, the stacker stepping laterally as the pile
  grows. Intermediate blending, and sensitive to the layer inclination.
* **Chevcon.** Chevron travel combined with the stepping of cone shell, producing inclined layers
  along the pile. The best-blending method of the five: Loubser and de Korte measure VRR 0.121 for
  chevcon against 0.232 for cone shell on the same pile, and Bond et al. give a rule of thumb of about
  a ten to one variance reduction for chevcon reclaimed full-face.

WHAT THE PRODUCT MUST REPRODUCE. Not those exact digits, which come from a differently dimensioned
circular pile and whose source is internally inconsistent (see ``plans/stocktwin/findings.md``), but
the ORDER: chevcon below chevron below cone shell.
