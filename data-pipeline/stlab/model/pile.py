"""Method 8, the per-cell lot ledger, and the deposition and reclaim mechanics built on it.

THE DATA STRUCTURE. Every pad cell owns an ordered stack of lots, bottom to top. A lot records which
deposition event it came from, how many tonnes it is, its grades, and its coarse fraction. Depositing
pushes onto the stack; the relaxation cascade moves material from the TOP of a source stack to the top
of a destination stack, because that is what a real avalanche does; reclaiming pops according to the
geometry of the reclaim method. A reclaim cut's provenance is then the tonnage-weighted histogram of
the event ids it consumed.

THE PUBLISHED ANALOGUE, cited so the product does not imply it invented this. Zhao, Lu, Koch and
Hurdsman model a stockpile as a grid of voxels each holding a quality composition, and compute the
quality of a bucket-wheel cut in advance from it (Int. J. Miner. Process. 140, 32-42, 2015,
doi:10.1016/j.minpro.2015.04.012; Adv. Eng. Inform. 29(3), 680-695, 2015,
doi:10.1016/j.aei.2015.07.002). The near-real-time version driven by GPS dump and load positions is
Zhao, Lu, Statsenko and Koch, J. Eng. Des. Technol. 20(2), 497-515, 2021,
doi:10.1108/JEDT-12-2020-0541, whose abstract states that tracing ore grade at run-of-mine stockpiles
is hard with current fleet-management systems because the information is not available in real time.
That unsolved practical problem is what this product exists to make visible.

THE INVARIANTS. Provenance fractions of every cut sum to one, and deposited tonnes equal in-pile plus
reclaimed tonnes at every step. Both are tests. A ledger that silently loses or double-counts material
would still produce a plausible picture, which is exactly why the identities are checked numerically.

WHY THE TONNAGE PER COLUMN IS CACHED. Summing a column's lots on demand turns every deposit into a
walk over the whole ledger, and with a few hundred dumps that is the difference between a live
interaction budget and a stalled tab. ``col_t`` is maintained incrementally by every push and pop, and
``check_column_cache`` re-derives it from the lots so a test can prove the cache never drifts.

        ================  =====  =====  ===========================================================

        The full-face rule takes a PROPORTIONAL share of every lot in the column rather than working
        from the top, because a rake engages the whole face at once. Every other method works from the
        top down, which is what makes it miss the buried layers.

        THE MACHINE WALKS. A shallow-reaching machine cannot fill a cut from one station, so it
        advances along the pile until the cut is complete, exactly as it would on a pad. Returning one
        undersized cut per station instead would have produced thousands of tiny cuts, which is not
        what the plant receives and which would have made the reclaimed stream look far more variable
        than it is purely as an artefact of the model's step size.
