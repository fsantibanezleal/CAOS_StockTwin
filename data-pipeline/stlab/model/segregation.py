"""Method 4, kinetic size segregation in the flowing layer, solved as a conservation law.

THE MODEL. Gray and Thornton, "A theory for particle size segregation in shallow granular
free-surface flows", Proc. R. Soc. A 461(2057), 1447-1473, 2005, doi:10.1098/rspa.2004.1420.

Their result, with their equation numbers. The percolation velocities of each species relative to the
bulk are

    w_l - w = + q phi_s        (large particles are levered up)                              (3.10)
    w_s - w = - q phi_l        (small particles drain down)                                  (3.10)

with the mean segregation velocity

    q = (B / c) g cos(zeta)                                                                  (3.11)

Substituting into the small-particle mass balance and non-dimensionalising with the standard
avalanche scalings gives

    dphi/dt + d(phi u)/dx + d(phi v)/dy + d(phi w)/dz - Sr d/dz[ phi (1 - phi) ] = 0          (3.18)

where the segregation number

    Sr = q L / (H U)                                                                         (3.19)

is the ratio of the mean segregation velocity to the typical normal bulk velocity. When ``Sr`` is
zero the equation degenerates to pure tracer advection, that is, no segregation: that limit is the
product's negative control C02 and it comes free from this same solver rather than from a separate
code path, which is what makes the control meaningful.

WHAT IS SOLVED HERE. On a stockpile flank the avalanche is a shallow layer of roughly uniform
thickness flowing over a static bed. Taking plug flow and marching in the downslope coordinate ``x``
reduces (3.18) to a one-dimensional scalar conservation law in depth,

    dphi/dx + dF/dz = 0,      F(phi) = - Sr phi (1 - phi)

with no flux through the free surface or the base. ``phi`` is the volume fraction of the SMALL
species. ``F`` is convex, so a Godunov flux is exact for the Riemann problem at every interface.

WHY THIS RUNS LIVE. Thirty-two depth cells and a handful of sub-steps per downslope cell is a few
hundred floating-point operations per avalanche generation. The published continuum model is
therefore cheaper than the fitted parametric curve it might have been replaced with, and it is
defensible where the curve would not have been. That was the single most useful finding of the
research pass and it is recorded in ``plans/stocktwin/findings.md``.

THE COUPLING TO THE PILE. Fines drain to the BASE of the flowing layer. Material that stops on the
flank is drawn from that base, and material that keeps travelling is drawn from the top. So the toe,
which is fed by the material that travelled furthest, ends up coarse. Coarse-at-the-toe is therefore
an OUTPUT of the model, not a rule written into it.
